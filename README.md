## ▶️ How to Run the Game

> ⚠️ Due to the use of JavaScript modules (import statements), you cannot simply open `index.html` directly from your file system. You **must** run a local web server.

---

### ✅ Method 1: Using Python's Simple HTTP Server (**Recommended**)

If you have Python installed, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the game directory:

   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/karma-run-3d-game
   ```

3. Run the server:

   - For **Python 3**:

     ```bash
     python -m http.server
     ```

   - For **Python 2**:

     ```bash
     python -m SimpleHTTPServer
     ```

4. Open your browser and go to:\
   [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

---

### ⚙️ Method 2: Using Node.js `http-server` (Requires Node.js)

1. Install `http-server` globally:

   ```bash
   npm install -g http-server
   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/karma-run-3d-game
   ```

3. Start the server:

   ```bash
   http-server
   ```

4. Open your browser and go to the address provided by `http-server` (usually [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)).

## 📝 Important Note on Hindi Font (`Poppins_Medium_Regular.json`)

For the Hindi text to render correctly in 3D:

- The `Poppins_Medium_Regular.json` file in the `fonts/` directory **must** be a valid Three.js `typeface.json` file.
- This file should be generated by converting a standard Hindi font like `Poppins_Medium_Regular.ttf` using a tool like: 👉 [https://gero3.github.io/facetype.js/](https://gero3.github.io/facetype.js/)

### ✅ Ensure the following:

- You have the original `Poppins_Medium_Regular.ttf` (or similar Hindi font).
- You’ve converted it to `typeface.json` format.
- You've placed the generated `Poppins_Medium_Regular.json` file in the `fonts/` folder.

> 🔀 The game includes fallback mechanisms (like simple shapes instead of text) if font loading fails, but for the full experience, the correct font file is **essential**.
